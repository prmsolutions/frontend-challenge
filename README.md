# Proton Frontend Challenge v1

Congratulations, you've passed our technical interview! Now it's time for a more in-depth chance to get a sense of the problems we solve and how we solve them.

We've built a small application here, and we'd like you to make it better. You'll receive those instructions separately.

For our purposes and yours, we've Dockerized the application. Getting the application up and running should be as easy as setting your working directory to this folder, and then running

```
docker-compose up
```

and navigating to `localhost:3000`.

Feel free to add more components or modify the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml as part of your solution. Note, however, that if we can't run your code by running `docker-compose up` and navigating to `localhost:3000`, we will assume it doesn't work.
